Time to observe what happens when `+yum+` does an update from a system
perspective! In the `+yum+` tab run:

[source,bash]
----
yum update -y
----

The first thing that `+yum+` does is updates repository metadata. This
is going to create activity on your _gethostlatency_ terminal and your
_tcplife_ terminal as the data is being downloaded from the Red Hat
Content Delivery Network (CDN). You can look at those tool outputs to
see the network connections that the `+yum update+` establishes in real
time.

You will see entries on our _gethostlatency_ tab similar to:

TIME PID COMM LATms HOST 08:45:23 75923 yum 0.10 localhost 08:45:25
75924 yum 375.39 subscription.rhsm.redhat.com 08:45:27 75926 yum 109.50
subscription.rhsm.redhat.com 08:45:38 75927 yum 10.23 cdn.redhat.com
08:45:39 75929 yum 10.21 cdn.redhat.com 08:45:40 75931 yum 10.18
cdn.redhat.com

....

these show `yum` looking up IP addresses for localhost, subscription.rhsm.redhat.com, and cdn.redhat.com. `gethostlatency` makes it really easy to know what hosts our application is talking to.

Also look at the *cachestat* tab and you should see output similar to:

<pre class="file">
    HITS   MISSES  DIRTIES  BUFFERS_MB  CACHED_MB
      14        0        0           0       1681
    2768        0        0           0       1699
     596        0        0           0       1700
    4143        0        0           0       1708
    3252        0        0           0       1698

<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
....

This shows that you are operating entirely on system cache and not
having to retrieve data from storage at this point in the operation.

Look at your _tcplife_ tab when `+yum+` has finished downloading
packages. You will see output similar to the sample below:

PID COMM LADDR LPORT RADDR RPORT TX_KB RX_KB MS 75963 yum 172.17.0.39
38054 2.16.30.83 443 23 138393 36375.04 75963 yum 172.17.0.39 38054
2.16.30.83 443 24 163378 36374.62 75963 yum 172.17.0.39 38054 2.16.30.83
443 22 163223 36374.69 ```

The output shows you that `+yum+` has established a connection on port
443 to IP address 2.16.30.83. Further, according to the sample output
above, that connection lasted for 36375.04 milliseconds, or 36.37504
seconds. This correlates to the amount of time `+yum+` spent downloading
packages.
