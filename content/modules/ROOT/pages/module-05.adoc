Next, `+yum+` will begin installing the updates and removing old
packages. To do this, `+yum+` is going to use the disk and memory
resources; you will monitor this using `+filetop+`, `+xfsslower+` and
`+cachestat+`.

In the _filetop_ tab, you will start to see files being read and written
to disk. As `+yum+` reads files from an rpm package, it writes them out
to the disk. Below is what the read operations should look like:

TID COMM READS WRITES R_Kb W_Kb T FILE 77699 yum 7 0 2 0 R
stat.h;5e5574b8 77699 yum 3 0 0 0 R tc_defact.h;5.5574b8 77699 yum 1 0 0
0 R rpmsg.h;5e5574b8 77699 yum 2 0 0 0 R midi.h;5e5574b8 << OUTPUT
ABRIDGED >>

....

From the above output, you can see in the Type column(T) that these are regular files(R). Further, you can see the counters in the READS column report greater than 0. This shows you in, real time, what `yum` is doing with files on the system.

Further, on the *xfsslower* tab, you will start to see XFS operations take longer than the 10ms threshold and disk operations will start to be displayed:

09:22:58 b'yum'         77726  S 0       0          13.83 b'packages.db-journal'
09:22:58 b'yum'         77726  S 0       0          14.16 b'packages.db-journal'

<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
....

In the above output, you see the file that `+yum+` is working on and the
latency in the LAT(ms) column, the data above shows that the longest
latency was 567.45 milliseconds while accessing the packages.db-journal
file. If you wish to improve the speed of `+yum update+` on this system
by reducing latency, you may want to look at upgrading the underlying
storage of this system.

If you look at the _cachestat_ tab, you will see that the number of
misses on the cache has gone up during the `+yum+` package installation
procedure as it is starting to need access to data that is not cached:

HITS MISSES DIRTIES BUFFERS_MB CACHED_MB 0 62 0 0 1701 0 52 0 0 1702 45
2 0 0 1701 5721 3777 0 0 1716 18683 6606 0 0 1747 14853 6223 0 0 1778 0
2 0 0 1778

<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >> ```

If you keep watching the _cachestat_ terminal, you will notice that the
number of misses goes back down to zero after the `+yum update+`
completes. This is because when the `+yum update+` is finished, the
virtual machine returns to a more idle state and there is very little
running that needs access to storage.
