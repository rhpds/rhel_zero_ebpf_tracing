In this lab, you have now observed: host name resolution, tcp connection
information, file activity (in real time), filesystem latency, and
realtime hits and misses on the memory cache on a Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 8 system. Tools utilizing eBPF, such as those shipped with
bcc-tools in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, are very powerful and allow you
quick access to information about the kernel and your systems.

Take a look at how many tools are provided by bcc-tools:

[source,bash]
----
ls -l /usr/share/bcc/tools | wc -l
----

125

....

The 125 tools, counted in the example above, can be easily inspected or even modified since they are actually Python scripts:

```bash
file /usr/share/bcc/tools/biolatency
....

/usr/share/bcc/tools/biolatency: Python script, ASCII text executable
```

Each of the tools shipped in the bcc-tools package contains a portion
written in C language which is the code of the eBPF program which, after
compilation, is passed to the kernel via the bpf() system call and used
for collection and analysis of the data. The Python script then reads
output of this eBPF program and allows easy formatting or further
processing.
